# Autonomous driving - Car detection

This assignment is a slight modification of the programming assignment in Week 3 of Course 4 of the DeepLearning.AI Deep Learning Specialization on Coursera. In particular, this implementation replaces a dependency on scipy with imageio for image plotting, and for some reason, I can't get the video clip above Figure 1 to play. I had hoped to make this assignment compatible with TensorFlow 2.x, but that proved too much of a hassle. I've instead decided to take a different approach; one that factors computation time and resource expenditure.

**Important note:** Some of the links in the hints will take you to documentation pages for TensorFlow 2.x. functions. If they do, click on the button underneath the function's name reading "TensorFlow 1 version".

**You will learn to**:
- Use object detection on a car detection dataset
- Deal with bounding boxes
