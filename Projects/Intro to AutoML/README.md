# AutoML can be a strong tool to ensure optimal data models while scaling applications and to maintain repeatability.
## Motivation
In this project we explore the capabilities of AutoML through TPOT with possible extensions to autosklearn libraries.

We use 25k random samples from train and test data, respectively for this exercise (to demonstrate AutoML libraries).
