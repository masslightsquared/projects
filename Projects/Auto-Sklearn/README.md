# Auto-Sklearn

Auto-sklearn is an automated machine learning toolkit and a drop-in replacement for a scikit-learn estimator.
It frees a machine learning user from algorithm selection and hyperparameter tuning. It leverages recent advantages in Bayesian optimization, meta-learning and ensemble construction.
