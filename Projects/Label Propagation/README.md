# Label Propagation

Label propagation is similar to training a classification model and then using that model to make predictions on test data. The key difference is that in general, our analogue to the test data has no labels against which to evaluate our model. In this exercise, we keep the entire set of true labels for illustrative purposes, but the vast marjority of them play no role in training the model. 

## This exercise is adapted from scikit-learn's [tutorial](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/semi_supervised/plot_label_propagation_digits.html) on zero shot learning.
