**CycleGAN Day2Night**

This project's motivation is to develop new software around automated detection of cars and pedestrians at all conditions for autonomous drive. One major bottleneck is data collection under severe weather conditions, especially capturing night-time images. So your task is to generate night time equivalent images from daytime images, such that you have access to some outdoor images acquired at night and some at day, but no pairwise images are available.
