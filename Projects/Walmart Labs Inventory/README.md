# Today you are a Machine Learning Engineer at the Department of Marketing and Inventory @Walmart Labs.
This work relies on processed data from Kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/mkechinov/ecommerce-behavior-data-from-multi-category-store

This work is motivated by the publication https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.02503.pdf

## You have access to the Walmart server data, specifically the Electronics section, such that you have NO customer facing information, but, only access to timestamped data regarding product viewing/carting/purchasing as follows.

## Motivation
You have access to user journey level data. Your goal is to perform the following:
### A. To identify what features are most important to classify purchasing customers from non-purchasing customers
### B. To predict a purchasing customer-product interaction from a no-purchasing one. The goal is to build the "best" data model with regards to Recall and F1-score.
