# COVID-19 Time Series Data

<img src="./case_growth.PNG" width="500px"></img>

## Motivation
In this project I used regression models to analyze the COVID-19 confirmed cases dataset published by the Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) at Johns Hopkins University. 
 
```
The dataset's features are:
*Province/State 
*Country/Region 
*Latititude 
*Longitude 
*Time series of confirmed cases from January 22, 2020 to August 29, 2020. 

Each row of the dataset can be conceptualized as representing a Country or Region, where we are given the geographical location and number of confirmed cases within for that region. There are 266 countries and each sample (country) has 225 features.
