# Zero Shot Learning (ZSL), or learning when NO prior similar training data has been encountered!
# Embarrsingly simple zero-shot learning

This is the implementation of the paper "An embarrassingly simple approach to zero-shot learning." (EsZsl) ICML, [[pdf]](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v37/romera-paredes15.pdf). 

The file `demo_eszsl` is a jupyter notebook which contains a walk through of EsZsl.

## Dataset

The dataset splits can be downloaded [here](https://www.mpi-inf.mpg.de/departments/computer-vision-and-multimodal-computing/research/zero-shot-learning/zero-shot-learning-the-good-the-bad-and-the-ugly/), please download the `Proposed Split` and place it in the same folder. 

Find additional details about the dataset in the `README.md` of the `Proposed split`.

## Training and Testing

If you want to skip the demo and just run training and testing for different dataset splits use:

```
python main.py --dataset SUN --dataset_path xlsa17/data/ --alpha 3 --gamma 1

```
Setting the hyperparameters alpha and gamma is optional. If the values are not given, the code will evaluate on the train and validation set to find the best hyperparameters.

## Results

This version does not have the kernel implementation used in the paper. Hence the results fluctuate by a margin of 1-4%. 

The results are taken from the paper [Zero-Shot Learning - A Comprehensive Evaluation of the Good, the Bad and the Ugly](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1707.00600.pdf) and are evaluated for features extracted from ResNet-50 for the Proposed split.

| Dataset       | Paper - (top-1 accuracy in %) | Respository Results | Hyper-params(trainval & test) |
