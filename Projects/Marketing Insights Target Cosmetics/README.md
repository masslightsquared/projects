# Marketing Insights Target Cosmetics
You have access to the Target server data, specifically the Cosmetics section, such that you have NO customer facing information, but, only access to timestamped data regarding product viewing/carting/purchasing.

You have access to first 250,000 user-journeys only and you have been asked to create a proof of concept analysis based on this data. Your task is to perform the following:
* A. Find patterns between customer purchasing behaviors to identify categories of customers. I.e. how many categories of customers are there based on their purchasing rates? We have repeat customers here since people buy other cosmetics based on their past purchases.

* B. Visually inspect the customer categories to identify the distinctive categories and their corresponding descriptive features.
